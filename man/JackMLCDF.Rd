Calculates confidence intervals for MLCDF estimator using jackknife procedure

\details{
Let suppose a non stratified sampling design in frame A and a stratified sampling design in frame B where frame has been divided into L strata and a sample of size \eqn{n_{Bl}} from the \eqn{N_{Bl}} composing the l-th stratum is selected
In this context, jackknife variance estimator of a estimator \eqn{\hat{Y}_c} is given by
 \deqn{v_J(\hat{Y}_c) = \frac{n_{A}-1}{n_{A}}\sum_{i\in s_A} (\hat{Y}_{c}^{A}(i) -\overline{Y}_{c}^{A})^2 + \sum_{l=1}^{L}\frac{n_{Bl}-1}{n_{Bl}}  \sum_{i\in s_{Bl}} (\hat{Y}_{c}^{B}(lj) -\overline{Y}_{c}^{Bl})^2}
with \eqn{\hat{Y}_c^A(i)} the value of estimator \eqn{\hat{Y}_c} after dropping \eqn{i-th} unit from \code{ysA} and \eqn{\overline{Y}_{c}^{A}} the mean of values \eqn{\hat{Y}_c^A(i)}.
Similarly, \eqn{\hat{Y}_c^B(lj)} is the value taken by \eqn{\hat{Y}_c} after dropping j-th unit of l-th from sample \code{ysB} and \eqn{\overline{Y}_{c}^{Bl}} is the mean of values \eqn{\hat{Y}_c^B(lj)}.
If needed, a finite population correction factor can be included in frames by replacing \eqn{\hat{Y}_{c}^{A}(i)} or \eqn{\hat{Y}_{c}^{B}(lj)} with \eqn{\hat{Y}_{c}^{A*}(i)= \hat{Y}_{c}+\sqrt{1-\overline{\pi}_A} (\hat{Y}_{c}^{A}(i) -\hat{Y}_{c})} or
\eqn{\hat{Y}_{c}^{B*}(lj)= \hat{Y}_{c}+\sqrt{1-\overline{\pi}_B} (\hat{Y}_{c}^{B}(lj) -\hat{Y}_{c})}, where \eqn{\overline{\pi}_A = \sum_{i \in s_A}\pi_{iA}/nA} and \eqn{\overline{\pi}_B = \sum_{j \in s_B}\pi_{jB}/nB}
A confidence interval for any parameter of interest, \eqn{Y} can be calculated, then, using the pivotal method.
